# Ikama Tasuwi
a Sitelen Pona descendant for the Kokanu IAL

* [interactive dictionary and test drive](https://haleyhalcyon.github.io/kokanu)

## About
Ikama Tasuwi (Drawn Words) is a Sitelenponido for [Kokanu, the Minimal IAL](https://kokanu.com). It was made as an attempt to bridge the gap between Kokanu and its parent language Toki Pona, while reflecting how far it has diverged from it.

## Design goals
* If there is a directly corresponding word in Toki Pona, use that Sitelen Pona, except for:
  1. Color words, which have been replaced with a new radical.
  2. *ha* (<*tu* - two), which has been replaced with the Hindu-Arabic numeral “2” to match the other number words.
  3. Words for which the [Sitelen Sa](https://jackhumbert.github.io/sitelen-sa/) looks better to me than Sitelen Pona: *cina* (<*lili* - small), *ci* (what) and *ka* (interrogative particle) (both from <*seme*), *o* (<*o*) 
  4. Other ad-hoc exceptions, such as:
    * *nan* (<*ken* - can, able to), which no longer makes sense being represented by a capital K.
    * *inpali* (≈*iseki* - flower), which I drew before I knew of *iseki*
    * *meja* (≈*kisa* - cat), *cuwi* (≈*misa* - mouse), *suwina* (≈*kolo* - pig), which I drew before I knew of any of these Sitelen Pona coinages
    * *ju* (<*wile* - want), using the closed variant, so that I can use the ω shape for *titi* (breasts)
* If there is no directly corresponding word, the Ikama Tasuwi glyphs are:
  1. derivations from other Ikama Tasuwi or from Sitelen Pona:
    * **Antonymization:** *uli* (weak) is an 180° rotated *len* (<*wawa* - strong). *ujanu* (awake) is *antomi* (<*lape*, asleep) 90° rotated, so that the stickman head that was lying down is now upright.
    * **Visual punning:** *wala* (sibling) has two “children” under the “parent” from *matuwa* (<*mama* - parent).
    * **Negation stroke:** *napa* (pure) is the yin-yang symbol—*huwonho* (mixed)—with a stroke through it.
  3. internationally recognizable symbols:
    * *wiki* (fast) and *tile* (slow) are taken from audio/media symbols for “fast forward” and “slow”.
    * *huwonho* (mixed) is a simplified yin-yang symbol.
    * *iwe* (imply) is the double-stemmed right arrow “⇒”, the “implies” logic symbol in Boolean logic.
    * *joli* (beneficial), *juka* (detrimental), and *peman* (vow/promise) are gestures represented in Sutton SignWriting: respectively, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, and pinky-promise.
    * Sometimes Japan-specific symbols: While *katin* (difficult) is two diamonds, referencing the biking/skiing trail difficulty symbol, *sula* (easy) is the Japanese novice driver symbol.
  4. new original/arbitrary glyphs:
    * *nan* is represented by a flexing bicep, showing off one’s own power or ability.
    * *haja* (*alive*), represented by a heart shape with a heart rate monitor line going through it, is the antonym of *tiku* (<*moli*, dead), represented by a stickman head with two crossed-out eyes.

## Licence
As of yet, Ikama Tasuwi is unfinished, and anyone can use it with the caveat that some logograms are subject to change. Feedback is welcome in the official Kokanu Discord server and here on GitHub.
